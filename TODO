Absolutely! Let's simplify the checklist to make it more accessible to someone with moderate computer literacy, focusing on features and actions rather than technical terms:

## High Priority

### Prepare the Blueprint (asciimap.csv)

- [ ] Make sure the first row of the CSV has the correct measurements of where components go.
- [ ] Double-check that the rest of the rows use the right symbols for each type of part (e.g., "C" for connector).
- [ ] **Fix any errors:**
    - [ ] Empty cells in the first row
    - [ ] Measurements that don't look like "feet' inches''" (e.g., "2' 6''")
    - [ ] Numbers that can't be read as numbers

### Set Up the Parts Library

- [ ] Create a CSV file (`legend.csv`) that lists each symbol and the type of part it stands for.
- [ ] **Decide on the parts library format:**
    - [ ] **Option 1:** Put all the information about each part in one big file called `features.json`.
    - [ ] **Option 2:** Create a folder called `features` and put a separate file for each part inside (e.g., `connector.json`, `breakout.json`).
- [ ] Make sure each part in the library has the following details:
    - [ ] A unique name or ID
    - [ ] The color it should be drawn in
    - [ ] The basic shape it should be drawn as (e.g., rectangle, circle)

### Build the Diagram

- [ ] **Read the files:**
    - [ ] Get the measurements from the CSV.
    - [ ] Get the part symbols and types from `legend.csv`.
    - [ ] Get the details for each part type from the parts library.
- [ ] **Create a list of parts:**
    - [ ] Go through each symbol in the diagram.
    - [ ] Figure out what type of part it is based on the legend.
    - [ ] Get the details for that part from the library.
    - [ ] Calculate where to draw the part based on the measurements.
    - [ ] Create an object for the part that includes all its information.
- [ ] **Draw the diagram:**
    - [ ] Create a new blank diagram (SVG or DXF format).
    - [ ] Go through the list of parts.
    - [ ] For each part:
        - [ ] Draw the part on the diagram based on its type, location, color, and shape.
        - [ ] Add a label (like an ID) next to the part if needed.
    - [ ] **Error Handling:** Check for any problems while drawing.
    - [ ] Save the diagram as an SVG or DXF file.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Read any notes from the bottom of the `asciimap.csv` file.
- [ ] Add note markers (e.g., circles) and the note text to the diagram.
- [ ] Make the part shapes look more detailed or accurate (if needed).

## Low Priority

- [ ] Figure out how to use the wire lookup table to color wires differently.
- [ ] Let the user choose different colors for parts and wires.
- [ ] Add features that let the user zoom in, move around, or click on parts for more info.
- [ ] Let the user choose how big the diagram should be.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Automatically create a legend on the diagram that explains the symbols.
- [ ] Add a title block or other notes to the diagram.
- [ ] Save the diagram in other formats like PNG or PDF.
